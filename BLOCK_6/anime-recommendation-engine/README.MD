# Anime recommendation engine üèØ

Welcome to our Data Science & Engineering fullstack project !

## Description

This app provides personalized anime recommendations using three main approaches:

- **User-based filtering**: Suggestions are based on what you've watched, liked, and commented on, as well as the preferences of similar users.  
- **Content-based filtering**: Recommendations are made by analyzing the content of anime descriptions to find similar titles.

- **Describe filtering**:  "Tell us what you want ‚Äî or don‚Äôt want ‚Äî and we‚Äôll recommend the perfect anime !"

Also in the app :

- **EDA**: An analysis of the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/marlesson/myanimelist-dataset-animes-profiles-reviews" target="_blank">Anime dataset found on Kaggle</a>

- **Review summarization**: An AI generated review based on all users's reviews

- **Diffusion list for new content**: A generated list of users based on the new synopsis and their favorite animes

Enjoy discovering new anime tailored to your tastes!
