## Description

[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/?l=french) is a video game digital distribution service and storefront from Valve. It was launched as a software client in September 2003 to provide game updates automatically for Valve's games, and expanded to distributing third-party titles in late 2005. Steam offers various features, like digital rights management (DRM), game server matchmaking with Valve Anti-Cheat measures, social networking, and game streaming services. Steam client's functions include game update automation, cloud storage for game progress, and community features such as direct messaging, in-game overlay functions and a virtual collectable marketplace.

We are going to you conduct a global analysis of the games available on Steam's marketplace in order to better understand the videogames ecosystem and today's trends.

The ultimate goal of this project is to understand what factors affect the popularity or sales of a video game. But your boss asked you to take advantage of this opportunity to analyze the video game market globally.

To carry out this project, we'll have to adopt different levels of analysis :
- 🌐 Analysis at the "macro" level
- 🔎 Genres analysis
- 🎮 Platform analysis
